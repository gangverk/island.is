# AI-Assisted Markdown Planning for Cursor Rules

Rules to enforce writing a markdown specification before AI-generated code.

<rule>
name: markdown_specification_requirement
description: Ensure that AI-generated code is preceded by a markdown planning document
filters:
  # Match any source code files
  - type: file_extension
    pattern: "\\.(js|ts|py|java|swift|go|rs|cpp|cs|rb|php)$"
  # Match file creation events
  - type: event
    pattern: "file_create"

actions:
  - type: reject
    conditions:
      - pattern: "^(?!\.\/docs\/specs\/.*\.md$)"
        message: "All AI-generated code must have a corresponding markdown specification file in docs/specs/"

  - type: suggest
    message: |
      Before writing AI-generated code, ensure that:
      
      1. A markdown file exists in `docs/specs/` with a structured plan:
         ```
         docs/specs/
         ├── feature-name.md
         ├── module-name.md
         └── ...
         ```
      
      2. The markdown file must contain:
         - A clear description of the feature/module
         - Expected inputs and outputs
         - Constraints and edge cases
         - Any relevant design decisions
      
      3. Example markdown structure:
         ```markdown
         # Feature: User Authentication
         
         ## Description
         This feature enables secure user authentication.
         
         ## Inputs
         - Email
         - Password
         
         ## Outputs
         - JWT Token on success
         - Error messages on failure
         ```
      
      4. AI-generated code should reference the corresponding markdown spec.
      
      5. Never write AI-generated code without an explicit markdown plan.

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: AI-generated code without a markdown plan
      src/auth.js
      
      # Good: Markdown plan exists before AI-generated code
      docs/specs/auth.md
      src/auth.js
    output: "Correctly structured AI-driven development workflow"
